"""Which graphics card draws the pages, asked before the browser starts.

His machine has two: an RTX 5080 and the processor's own Intel
graphics. Which one the engine ends up on is decided by environment
variables read when the GPU process starts, so the question has to be
asked and answered before any of the browser exists -- a plain Qt
window, no engine behind it, and the answer carried into a fresh start
of the program.

This box has one Intel card and no second GPU, so what can be measured
here is the reading, the listing, the environment that comes out of a
choice, the window itself and the path that does not ask. That the
5080 really takes over is the one thing only his machine can say.
