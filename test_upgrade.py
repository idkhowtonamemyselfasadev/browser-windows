"""A true cross-version test: the browser as it was BEFORE any of this
work writes a vault, and the browser as it is now reads it.

The old code is checked out of git rather than imitated, so this proves
the real upgrade path — the one your own passwords.json will take —
without ever going near your file. Then it goes back the other way:
the old build reads a vault the new one wrote, because a downgrade
should not lose your logins either.
