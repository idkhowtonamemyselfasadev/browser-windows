"""Downloads and files: the record, the file, the archives, the
pictures, and the handoffs to other programs.

Offscreen, scratch data, local server. Every file this makes is made
here, in the scratch folder, so nothing in the real downloads folder is
touched.

Measured rather than assumed, and said in the check: there is no
yt-dlp, no clamscan and no torrent client on this box, and no 3D
printer on this network -- so those four are tested by what the browser
says when the program is missing, plus (for the printer) the request it
builds, against a stand-in in the harness.
