"""A dead renderer must not leave a blank, unclickable tab.

When a tab's render process dies -- a crash, an out-of-memory kill, or the
GPU process taking it down -- Qt leaves the QWebEngineView blank and
unresponsive. Nothing loads, nothing takes a click: the classic "dead
tab". new_tab now connects renderProcessTerminated to _render_gone,
which reloads once to bring a fresh renderer up, and only if that dies too
falls back to a plain recovery page with a link to try again -- never a
black hole.

This drives _render_gone directly (a renderer cannot be crashed to order
offscreen) and checks each branch. Offscreen, scratch data; the real vault
and config are never opened.
