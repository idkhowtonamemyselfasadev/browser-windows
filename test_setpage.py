"""Settings as a page: nothing listed twice, nothing silently dead,
and a sheet you can see the window through.

He opened Settings and found two sections called "The address bar",
one after the other. Underneath that were worse things of the same
kind: two different switches sharing one id, so one of them was never
found and never did anything; a never-sleep list and a screen-awake
switch sharing one config key, so the switch wiped the list; and a
"Browsing" section that had grown into a dumping ground of 23 panels
while "Downloads" held two rows.

So this measures the page itself -- the file, the rail it builds, and
the behaviour behind the two switches that collided -- rather than how
it looks."""
