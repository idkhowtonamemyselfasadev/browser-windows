"""A reload the user asked for takes back a "no".

Site permissions (microphone, camera, notifications) are answered once
and then remembered for the rest of the run. A yes is worth keeping - a
no was a trap: it was replayed in silence for hours, and the only way to
be asked again was to restart the whole browser. One mis-aimed click on
a call's microphone card and the call was mute.

Firefox's rule is the one that makes sense: a temporary block lasts
until the page is reloaded. This drives the real code and asserts it:

  * a deny is still remembered until something happens,
  * a reload the user asked for empties the book of noes - by the
    toolbar's path, by reload() on the view and by the context menu's
    Reload action,
  * a yes survives it, and so does an "always" stored in the config,
  * a reload no user asked for (the page reloading itself, which reaches
    the engine and never Qt) changes nothing,
  * the private book and the normal one never empty each other.

Offscreen, against scratch data; your own vault and config are never
opened.
