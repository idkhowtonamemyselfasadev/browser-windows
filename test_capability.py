"""A control the browser shows is a promise it can keep.

Three bugs in one day were the same shape, and they were found one at a
time in three different editions:

    the Subtitles button    bridge.playerSubtitles existed nowhere.
                            Guarded, so clicking it did nothing at all.
    the Graphics button     "Open Windows' graphics settings", offered
                            on macOS, whose handler opens with
                            `if sys.platform != "win32": return False`.
    the PSI switch          "Sleep background tabs before the machine
                            swaps" reads /proc/pressure/memory. Where
                            there is no such file the reading stays 0.0,
                            `0.0 >= limit` is never true, and the
                            browser watches nothing.

Every one of them is the UI's idea of what exists and the code's idea
of what runs being maintained separately, with nothing comparing them.
The result is worse for the person than a missing feature, because the
control's presence IS the promise.

The browser already answers these questions -- the payload carries a
flag per optional thing -- so this suite checks the other half: that
the page actually READS each flag and hides what the flag is about.
Two of them were being computed and ignored.

It deliberately does NOT try to find gated handlers mechanically. A
scan for functions branching on sys.platform returns 30 here, of which
23 look "silent" -- and most of those are _write_private, _pid_alive,
main and friends, which are plumbing and correctly say nothing. Without
a reachability analysis from control to handler that scan is a hunting
tool, not a test, and a test that cries wolf gets switched off. So this
is a written-down table, small and exact, and the pin is what keeps it
from rotting.

No window; reads the payload and the page.
