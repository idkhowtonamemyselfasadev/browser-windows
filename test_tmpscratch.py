"""The scratch directories have to be taken back, including by the
runs that cannot take back their own.

/tmp here is tmpfs, so one left behind is RAM the next suite cannot
have: 1,348 of them holding 3.7 GB on 2026-10-29, and another
session's write failed because of it. What it looks like from inside a
suite is six consecutive crashes with no failed check, because a
browser that cannot write its profile dies looking like a bug in
whatever it was doing.

The case this suite exists for is the one that defeated the old
cleanup entirely: a run that ends with os._exit. atexit does not run
then, and 19 suites end that way on purpose, to dodge a Qt teardown
segfault. So the runs most likely to leak were exactly the ones that
had opted out of the only mechanism that would have cleared up. The
fix is to sweep at STARTUP as well -- whoever comes next clears up --
and section (5) drives a real os._exit subprocess to prove it.

Everything here happens in its own TMPDIR. It never looks at the real
/tmp and never removes anything outside its own fixture, which is
browser-mac-8f's method: the 1,348 directories are a separate
question, and a suite that reclaims gigabytes as a side effect of
being run is not a suite anybody can trust.
