"""Process-lifecycle safety: single instance, hand-off, crash detection.

The bugs this guards against were live in the field and were costing
real data and sanity:

 * a `kill -9` cleanup left a stale single-instance socket, and the next
   launch would not reclaim it -- it must, when the owner is gone;
 * a busy primary missed the old 300ms probe, so a relaunch removed the
   socket unconditionally and became a SECOND browser on the same
   profile, whereupon new tabs rendered blank and took no input. A live
   instance must never be displaced;
 * `--background` (the `music` command) became a window-owning primary
   instead of handing its URL to the running browser as a quiet tab;
 * a second launch read the still-set "runOpen" flag as a crash and wiped
   history/cookies out from under the healthy first instance. Crash
   detection is now pid + start-time based: a live owner is not a crash.

All offscreen, against scratch data; the real vault and config are never
opened. No page is loaded to completion, so nothing here depends on the
network or on QtWebEngine finishing a load.
