"""The script that runs on YouTube, which had no test in its life.

YOUTUBE_JS gates itself on the youtube.com hostname, so nothing served
from a test server could ever reach it, and all three of its parts went
unchecked: the codec gate (now removed), the ad scrub, and the
wall-remover. The suite gets past the gate by running the real source
with `location` shadowed -- the script reads the hostname once, through
that name, so handing it a different object is enough. Nothing pretends
to be YouTube on the network.

Adopted from browser-linux (155edee..9306a97) rather than written
here, so it keeps reading as one suite across the editions. One
line differs and says so where it stands: the sampler it names in
the profile list does not exist in this edition.

What is checked here is what the script is FOR: that it installs
nothing anywhere else, that the ad data goes out of player data in
place, that a wall that reaches the screen is taken off it, and that
what the engine can play is left to the engine to answer.
